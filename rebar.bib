	Both large and small sample theory show that adjustment for the scalar
	propensity score is sufficient to remove bias due to all observed
	covariates. Applications include: (i) matched sampling on the univariate
	propensity score, which is a generalization of discriminant matching,
	(ii) multivariate adjustment by subclassification on the propensity
	score where the same subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects
	for all outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii) visual
